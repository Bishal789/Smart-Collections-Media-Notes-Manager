(Smart Collections is designed as a modular JavaFX application. The architecture separates the UI, data models, and services to ensure scalability and maintainability. The Main class handles UI and event logic, while models like Item and Task encapsulate data. Services like IndexService manage indexing and searching.) Tj

(Appropriate data structures were chosen for each feature. ObservableList is used for the library to support dynamic updates in the UI. Stack is used for undo and recently viewed operations due to its LIFO nature. PriorityQueue is used for task management to ensure tasks are processed by priority. Maps and Sets are used for efficient indexing and duplicate prevention.) Tj

(Object I/O is used for saving and loading the library, indices, and tasks. A versioned file header ensures compatibility. The app gracefully handles corrupted or missing files by starting with an empty library.) Tj
